In this project, a comprehensive data analysis and visualization were conducted on a Hotel bookings dataset. The dataset was sourced from a reputable data provider, and it contains relevant information about hotel bookings, including booking dates, customer details, room types, reservation status, and other relevant metrics.

The first step of the project involved data cleaning using Microsoft Excel. Data cleaning was essential to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and free from any anomalies. Excel's powerful data manipulation features were utilized to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats. This process enhanced the overall quality of the dataset, making it suitable for further analysis and visualization.

Once the data cleaning process was completed, Tableau was employed to create insightful visualizations and gain valuable insights from the hotel bookings data.

Several visualizations were developed to understand different aspects of hotel bookings. Some of the visualizations included:

1. A time series line chart showcasing the trend of hotel bookings over time, allowing for identification of booking patterns and seasonal trends.

2. A bar graph representing the distribution of bookings across various room types, aiding in analyzing room preferences of customers.

3. Interactive dashboards that allowed users to filter and drill down into specific data segments, facilitating a deeper understanding of booking trends based on customer demographics, reservation status, and more.

To enhance the visualizations further, Tableau's features such as Measure Names and Measure Values were utilized to handle multiple measures effectively.

The analysis revealed valuable insights for hotel management, marketing teams, and customer service departments. For example, peak booking periods were identified, enabling better resource allocation and pricing strategies. Customer preferences for room types were also observed, which could lead to targeted marketing campaigns.

Overall, this data analysis and visualization project provided actionable insights for hotel stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize their operations, ensuring a seamless and delightful experience for their customers.
